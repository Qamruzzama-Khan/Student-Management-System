## Student Management System

The Student Management System is a web application designed to manage and display student records efficiently. Users can add, edit, and delete student information through a user-friendly interface. The system features a form for entering student details, including serial number, name, faculty, and roll number. These records are displayed in a table format with options to edit or delete entries. The application utilizes localStorage to persist student data across page reloads, ensuring that all information remains available. 

### Key features include:
- **Form Input**: Fields for serial number, name, faculty, and roll number.
- **Dynamic Table**: A table that updates with new student records and allows editing and deletion.
- **Local Storage Integration**: Automatically saves and retrieves student data to maintain state.

The system is styled for a clean, responsive design and includes button interactions for a smooth user experience.
